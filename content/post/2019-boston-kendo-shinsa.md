## Video: Matsushita Sensei explains kata
After the examination, Matsushita Sensei explained to everyone the importance of kendo kata.

Among his key points, Sensei explained that kata is not merely a series of steps that we memorize for taking exams. Rather, we must understand the ideas and principles behind each kata.

For example, one must keep in mind the correct *maai* (distance). In *ipponme,* a common mistake is for the *shidachi* to strike the *uchidachi's* *men* too short. The shidachi should not just go through the motions, but to aim at the right area.

Sensei asked everyone to continue training in kata. He said it will improve their kendo.

Here is a video of Sensei explaining kata in depth.

## Video: Matsushita Sensei and Katsunori demonstrate fast kata

Sensei and Katsunori Sensei demonstrate *nihonme* at a fast speed. Katsunori Sensei is really trying to strike Sensei's kote, so Sensei must avoid Katsunori's bokuto quickly.

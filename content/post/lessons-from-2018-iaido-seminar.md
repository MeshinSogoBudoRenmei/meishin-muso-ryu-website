Shuji Matsushita Sensei led the 2018 Fall Meishin Muso Ryu Iaido Seminar from Sept. 15-16 at Shudokan Dojo in Stroudsburg, PA. Here are some of our lessons ...

## *Kihon,* *Kihon* and More *Kihon*
During the two-day seminar, we reviewed *iaido* basics such as *kamae,* *uchikomi,* *zanshin,* *chiburi* and *noto.*

We also practiced *kata.* Sensei explained many fine details of our iaido school's *kata.* He noted what we were doing wrong and how to fix our mistakes.

Sensei described various *kamae* and their purposes. He noted their strengths and limitations as well.

Our body posture expresses what we are thinking and feeling. It can project our confidence and readiness ... or reveal our weakness and hesitation.

## 30 *Uchikomi* Each Day
One of the seminar's themes was "excuses." People make excuses for why they don't try to do their best.

Many people say they don't have time to train everyday because of family, work or other obligations. To prove us wrong, Sensei did 30 *uchikomi* and several other techniques under a minute. Indeed, you can do 30 *uchikomi* in less than a minute!

As Sensei told us repeatedly, training is practicing what you cannot do until you can do it.

## Michael Breaks His *Bokken*
As practice for a certain *kata*, we had to strike a dummy wearing a kendo bogu. We were working on cutting with the correct angle at the correct position.

My *sempai* **Michael Luckenbill** made a couple cuts ... and broke his wooden sword in half! Everyone was impressed at this feat. 

Later, Michael told us how some years back, he and other students did a drill where they had to break a *bokken* in one shot. It may have hurt the wallet in the short run, but it helped their *iaido* in the long run!

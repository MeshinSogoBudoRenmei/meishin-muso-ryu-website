We hosted our first kendo summer godogeiko ever on Saturday, July 21. Our dojo was lucky enough to train with several high-ranking sensei and their students from several dojos.

## Godogeiko all day

Everyone traveled here from Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and even Connecticut. Among the participants were three 7th dan sensei. They are our **Matsushita Shuji** sensei; **Vincent Lan** sensei; and **Joshua Caroll** sensei, who recently passed his 7th dan exam.

Lan sensei and his students joined us for morning training. We started with *kirikaeshi* and basic *men* strikes. Then it was *jigeiko* or free sparring! We trained nearly 2 hours and took a 2-hour break.

## *Nito* and *Jodan*

More sensei and their students joined us in the afternoon. We resumed at 5 p.m. Everyone stretched a little. Then we did *jigeiko* until almost 7 p.m.

Everyone trained hard and gave full effort. Since the weather was hot and humid, Matsushita sensei cautioned us to be careful of heat stroke. He told us to take a break if we don't feel well.

Among the many memorable events of the day ... **Mr. Paul Winters** of Kenshinkai used *nito* (two swords), while Matsushita sensei used *jodan no kamae* at one point. While I have seen these fighting styles at kendo tournaments, this was a rare and valuable opportunity to practice against them.

After a day of hard training, everyone relaxed and celebrated at our dojo's afterparty.

There was much food and discussions about kendo into the early morning hours.
